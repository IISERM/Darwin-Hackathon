# BDF Hackathon

## Vision

The aim of this hackathon is to come up with algorithms to solve problems in biology and biocomputation. The organisers feel that programming is in everyone's blood, for we are inherently algorithmic. Hence, the questions do **not** expect that you know some fancy set of functions to solve these problems. They just need you to think about how you would go about doing something.
Most of the questions are **not** inherently biological in nature. Biology however does provide motivation to solve these problems. The organisers feel that these questions do not need any particular knowledge of Biology (partly because the organisers themselves are not great fans of Biology ðŸ‘…). Theory and necessary references are linked with the questions.
Feel free to call the volunteers if you need additional information.

## Questions

Obviously its not up yet, d'you think we're dumb?
Until the event starts on 21st February 2021, 7pm, you can go through last year's DWH [here](2020) and CTM with Phi@I [here](https://iiserm.github.io/schrodinger-week/code-the-matrix)

Good Luck!
