## **Disclaimer**: We @ Turing are not a great fan of biology in general. We tried to get a few peopele from the biology department to help us with the questions, but apparently participating is much more interesting than making questions. So we have asked one person from BDF to stay back during the entire duration of the hackathon. Please ask us/BDF rep if you have any questions regarding the questions. We will try to answer them. 

## The aim of this hackathon is to come up with algorithms to solve problems in biology and bio-computation. The organizers feel that programming is in everyone's blood, for we are inherently algorithmic. Hence, the questions do **not** expect that you know some fancy set of functions to solve these problems. They just need you to think about how you would go about doing something.
