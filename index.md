# Vision

The aim of this hackathon is to come up with algorithms to solve problems in biology and bio-computation. The organizers feel that programming is in everyone's blood, for we are inherently algorithmic. Hence, the questions do **not** expect that you know some fancy set of functions to solve these problems. They just need you to think about how you would go about doing something.

Most of the questions are **not** inherently biological in nature. Biology however does provide motivation to solve these problems.

Feel free to call the volunteers if you need additional information.

Will appear here.

<!-- # Done!

After you solve the final question - you arrive at Galapagos to enjoy the rest of the evening with your friends, but not before-

- Renaming all your files as `Qx.ext`
- Putting them into a zip/tar file with name `teamname.zip`/`teamname.tar`
- Mailing them to turingclub@iisermohali.ac.in

# Enjoy!

Good Luck! -->
